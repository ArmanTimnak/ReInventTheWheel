# Contributing to Our Project

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/ArmanTimnak/ReInventTheWheel/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ArmanTimnak/ReInventTheWheel/issues); it's that easy!

## Writing Bug Reports

When reporting a bug, please provide as much detail as possible. This helps us understand and reproduce the issue, making it easier for us to fix it. Here's a guide on how to write an effective bug report:

### Background
Start by providing some background information about the bug. Explain what you were doing when the bug occurred and any relevant context. Include the version of the software you are using and the operating system/environment.

### Steps to Reproduce
Provide a step-by-step guide on how to reproduce the bug. Include any specific inputs, configurations, or actions required to trigger the issue. If possible, provide a minimal code example that demonstrates the problem.


## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* Adhere to PEP8 as much as possible.

* Line lengths should be under 120 characters, use list comprehensions over map/filter, don't leave trailing whitespace.

* More complex pieces of code should be commented for future reference.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
